# ✨ Coding is Magic

📖 Philosophy
This is not a tutorial site. Not a bootcamp.
It’s a grimoire of code, courage, and curiosity — handcrafted by a self-taught developer who believes learning to code should feel empowering, poetic, and a little bit magical.

“Taught myself code. Then taught AI not to be a condescending little shit.”
